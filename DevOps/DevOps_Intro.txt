Module 3: DevOps Overview

	1. Evolution of Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps
	2. What is DevOps
	3. Why DevOps
	4. Benefits of DevOps
	5. DevOps Stages
	6. DevOps Lifecycle
	7. Various Automation in DevOps
	8. Overview of CICD
	
	
	DevOps Modules :
	
	What is DevOps ?
	
	Software Applications ?
	
		- Desktop Applications
		
		- Web Applications
		
		- Mobile Applications 
		
		- Embedded Applications 
			- Chip Level Programming
			
			
	How the Software Applications are Created delivered to the End-Users ?
	
	SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle 
	
	Eg.: 
		Desktop Applications :
				
				- Super_Market Billing System  
				
					- Functions?
						- Stock_Management 
						- User_Interace Design
						- Billing
						- Payment:
							Mode of Payment - CASH/CARD 
						
				
				
	- Requirement Analysis
	- Document/Design
	- Coding 
	- Testing 
	- Implemented to Production
	- Maintenance / Monitor 
	
	
	Waterfall Model :
	
		- Linear/Top-Down Approach to Develop the software product 
		-

	- Requirement Analysis
	- Document/Design
	- Coding 
	- Testing 
	- Implemented to Production
	- Maintenance / Monitor 	
	
		Desktop Applications :
				
				- Super_Market Billing System  	--> 12 Months 
				
					- Functions/Modules
						- Stock_Management 
						- User_Interace Design
						- Billing
						- Payment:
							Mode of Payment - CASH/CARD/
								UPI++
								Mobile App
								
	
	Core Project :
	- Requirement Analysis
	- Document/Design
	- Coding 							7th Month of project 
	- Testing 
	- Implemented to Production
	- Maintenance / Monitor 		
			
								UPI++
								Mobile App
								
	Enhancement Project :					
	- Requirement Analysis
	- Document/Design
	- Coding 							
	- Testing 
	- Implemented to Production
	- Maintenance / Monitor 		


Domain :

		Telecomm Domain 
		
			SP1 --> Want to introduce new offer to their customer  
			SP2 --> 
			
		
		Retail Domain 


	- AGILE Methodologies :
	
		SDLC :
		
		- Requirement Analysis
		- Document/Design
		- Coding 							
		- Testing 
		- Implemented to Production
		- Maintenance / Monitor 	
		
			Desktop Applications :
					
					- Super_Market Billing System  	--> 12 Months 
					
						- Functions/Modules -> Iteration 
							- Stock_Management 
							- User_Interace Design
							- Billing
							- Payment:
								Mode of Payment - CASH/CARD/	

		
		Iteration 1 		# Stock_Management 
		
		- Requirement Analysis
		- Document/Design
		- Coding 							
		- Testing 
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		- Maintenance / Monitor	

		
		Iteration 2 		# User_Interace Design
		
		- Requirement Analysis
		- Document/Design
		- Coding 							
		- Testing 
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		- Maintenance / Monitor		
		
			
		Iteration nth 		# Mobile App
		
		- Requirement Analysis
		- Document/Design
		- Coding 							
		- Testing 
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		- Maintenance / Monitor	

			Using AGILE Methodologies:
			
				we can Achieve :
				
			
					- Continuous Development
					- Continuous Integration 
					- Continuous Testing 
					- Continuous Delivery 
						- Continuous Delivery approach expect Manual Approvals for Production Release
					
				We cannot Achieve :
				
					- Continuous Deployment 
						- Continuous Deployment approach Never expect Manual Approvals for Production Release
						- This allow the Automated Deployment to Production Environments.
						
						
	- DevOps :
	
		DevOps is a Softare Development Strategy, which help to promote the collaboration between the Teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployments and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
	
	How to Implement DevOps ?
	
	Teams :

		
		- DevOps Team	
			- Infra-Structure Management Team 
			- Application Development Team    
			- Testing Team 
			- Release Management Team 
			- Production Support Team 
			- Production Monitoring Team 
			- IT Security Team
