	Build Orchestration Tool - Jenkins.
	
	Jenkins - Is an Open-Source Build Orchestration Tool.
	Used Automate Application Builds and Deployments.
	
	Other Products :
	
		gitlab-ci
		bamboo
		Azure Pipelines
		AWS Code Pipeline 
		
	Jenkins Architecture :
	
		- Jenkins is based on Master-Slave Architecture ::
		
			Jenkins_Master Node(VM)		- Install jdk,jenkins,git.
										- Used to Create the CI/CD Pipeline Projects and schedule to run in slave nodes.
									
				Jenkins_Slave Node(VM)	- To Execute the Application Build.
										- Perform Application Build - Compile, Unit Test, Create Artifacts 
									

				- Build the Source Code 		
						# Is a process of Compiling the Source Code and Creating Artifacts(Binaries/Executables - *.exec/*.dll/*.jar/*.war)
						
		Scenario 1 :
			
			Jenkins_Master Node(VM)		- Install jdk,jenkins,git. Install Build Tools like maven
			
		Scenario 2 :
		
            Jenkins_Master Node(VM)		- Create the CI/CD Pipeline Projects and schedule to run in slave nodes.
			
				Jenkins_Slave_Node1(VM)	- Java Application Build maven
				Jenkins_Slave_Node2(VM)	- Python Application Build
				Jenkins_Slave_Node3(VM)	- .Net Application Build
				Jenkins_Slave_Node4(VM)	- Ruby Application Build
				Jenkins_Slave_Node5(VM)	- Angular/NodeJS Application Build
				
				
		CI/CD Workflow :::
		
			SCM_Checkout 
			Application Build 
			Unit Testing 
			Create Artifacts 
			Promote the Application to Test Environments
			Notify 
			Deploy to Prod 
			
	
	- Working with Jenkins ::
	
		- Developers' Perspective :
			- Developers are just the consumers of Jenkins Projects 
			- Developers can Execute/Cancel/Read the Jenkins Job Output
		
		
		- DevOps Perspective :
			- DevOps Team are the Administrator of Jenkins.
			
			Roles & Responsibilies of DevOps Team :			
			
			Jenkins Administration 
				- Installation of Jenkins
				- Plugins Management 
				- Global System Configurations 
				- Tools Management 
				- User Management 
				- Security Management				
				- Credential Management 
				- Master/Slave Node Configurations
				- Creation CICD Pipeline Projects 
				- Onboard Applications to use Jenkins CICD Projects  
				- Periodic Upgrade of Jenkins and its plugins 
				- Periodic Backup 
				- Troubleshooting the Issues!
				
	- Installation of Jenkins :::
	
		--> Jenkins can be installed in Linux - Ubuntu Machine AMI - v22.04
				https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/
				
				https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
				
			Jenkins run as a service, it runs in default port 8080

		- Security Management				
		- Credential Management 



	- Create Jenkins Projects :

		- Free Style Projects :
			# Based on manual configurations
		
		
			
	Handling Variables in Jenkins :
	
		- Environment Variables :
		
			"${JOB_NAME}"
		
		
		- User-Defined Variables :
		
		

		- Pipeline Projects		
			# Based on groovy scripts 
			# To onboard the Application to CICD Process.
			# Used to Automate the Builds and Deployments and any process automation.
	
			# Pipeline composed of various stages
			# Stages are used to execute some task.
			
			Jenkins_Master Node(VM)		- Create the CI/CD Pipeline Projects and schedule to run in slave nodes.
			
		CI/CD Workflow :::
		
			SCM_Checkout

		Types of Pipeline Projects :
		
			- Scripted Pipeline 
			
				
			
			- Declarative Pipeline 

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello1') {
            steps {
               sh 'echo "Hello1" >> file1.txt'
            }
        }
        stage('Hello2') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Hello2" >> file2.txt'
            }
        }
    }
}


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('SCM_Checkout') {
            steps {
               echo "Perform SCM Checkout"
            }
        }
        stage('Application Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Perform Application Build"
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Test Server') {
            steps {
                echo "Perform Application Deployment"
            }
        }
    }
}

Next :

	Setup Jenkins Master-Slave Node
	
	Create Application Build and Deployments using CICD Pipeline Project
