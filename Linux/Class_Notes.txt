	Linux :
	
		What is Linux ?
		
		- OS is an interface between User Applications and Underlying Hardware
		
		- Linux is an Open Source Operating System 
		- Linux OS was created based on Unix 
		
		- Linux Distributions :
		
			- Centos / RHEL 
			
			- Debian / Ubuntu
			
			- Fedora 
			
			- Amazon Linux
				- Based on Fedoro Distribution
				
		- Core of Linux OS is called as Kernel
			- Creates a dedicated Address Space to run any application/task/process
				- Storage 
				- Network 
				- IPC - Inter-Process Communication 
				- Security 
				- User Management
				- Namespaces 
				- Control Groups 
				- Process 
					- Will be assigned with unique process Id.
				
		- Linux Distributions :
		
			Flavors of Linux : 						Package Manager : 	Used to Manage the Packages
																		Install/Un-install/Update the Packages 
		
			- Centos / RHEL 				--		yum
			
			- Debian / Ubuntu***			--		apt-get / apt
			
			- Fedora 						--		dnf
			
			- Amazon Linux					--		dnf(latest Amazon Linux) / yum(previous version)
				- Based on Fedoro Distribution		
			
			- Package Managers are executed as a root user.
				Once we login to Linux Machine 
				Elevate the Access to root user level.
					sudo -i 		# To Elevate the access to root user.
		
		- Computing Device :
		
			- Desktop Machines 
			- Laptop 
			- Mobile Devices
			
	Learn Linux on DevOps Perspective :
	
		- DevOps Team Roles & Responsibilities :
		
			- Install all the DevOps Tools/Packages and Services on Linux Machines.
			- Package Management :
				- Periodic Upgrade of packages 
					Eg.: jdk11 --> jdk17 - Upgrade - update and clean-up the previous version
										 - Update  - Just Update to New Version 
				- Un-install the Packages
				- Back-up and Restore 
			
			- Remote Server Management - i.e., Client Server Architecture
			
				Server (VM)				
					- Client1,2,3,4,5 (VM)
					
			- Manage Linux Machines :
			
				- Package Management 
				- File Management 
				- User Management 
				- Access Management
				- Remote Server Management 
					SSH (Secure SHell) Protocol -	
						SSH Connection using Port 22.
						
							- Host Name 						
							- User Name 							
							- Credential
								Types of Authentication :								
									- Password based Authentication
									- Token based Authentication
									- Key based Authentication
										- Private key 
										- Authorized_keys / Public Key 
									- Passwordless Authentication

				- Process Automation
					- Linux Shell Scripting 
										



	1. Package Management :
	
		- Linux Module :
			AWS Cloud Platform :
			
		- Launch an EC2 Instance 
			- AMI Ubuntu v22.04	(Previous Version)
			- t2.mirco
			- existing key-pair
					
		- Connect to EC2 Instance 
			- EC2 Instance Connect through AWS Console web-browser
			
			- Terminals : Command prompt/gitbash/Terminal
			
			- Using SSH Agent:
				- MobaXterm -> https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html
								- Click on Installer Edition 
									- Downloads a *.zipfile 
										- Extract and run that exec file 
										
										
				- Host_Name 		-> <Public_IP Address>
				- User_Name 		-> ubuntu 
				- Private Key file 	-> *.pem
				
		- Login to Ubuntu Machine 		
	
		- Working Linux CLI Commands

		clear 			# Clear the Screen
		
		hostname		# To get the Host Name 
		
		sudo -i 		# To Elevate the access to root user.
		
		apt update 		# To update the default system and security packages
